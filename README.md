# MCF - Minimal Compact Framework v. 1.1
It's just a basic CSS framework, for school excercising with grids and responsive design. The name "Minimal Compact" of this little framework it's a dedication to the musical group Minimal Compact - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Compact , an Israeli rock band associated with the post-punk and indie rock movement of the 1980s. A lot of code in my life was written listening to wonderful music like this.

The folder flex/ contains a grid in flexbox, and float/ contains a classic float grid for old browsers. A version with CSS GRID is on the way.
